# BoltAutoMatch

The game in mind is a 1v1 match. 
Each client will choose a team (red or blue in this case) and will automatically try to match with a player.  
If they cannot find a game, they will stop looking for a game and host their own and wait for someone to join.
Once someone joins, it will remove the listing and not accept anyone else joining. 
Optionally you could have it start a bot game if they choose to stop searching/waiting.
